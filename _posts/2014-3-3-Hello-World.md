### The Best of Both Worlds

#### by Ben Deshaies  |  May 2, 2014

North Conway may be a little bit out of the way for some, but a visit at the right time of year echoes Ralph Waldo Emerson’s old adage 'life is a journey, not a destination.' The scenic Kancamagus Highway provides some of the most spectacular views of the White Mountains available. Don’t let the picturesque natural landscape fool you. North Conway and the surrounding areas are also home to modern shopping centers and many boutique stores. High end outlets can be found alongside quaint local shops. Depending on the season, one can find quality resorts for all sorts of activities. Skiing in the winter is a popular draw for many, as is golfing in the summer. North Conway is home to some of the best rock climbing in the Northeast as well. It is home to the International Mountain School which draws in enthusiasts from all over the world. And if it is foliage you seek, there are few better places in the world during the peak fall months. From family friendly to extreme adrenaline junky, a weekend in North Conway has something to offer everyone. 

## FRIDAY

### Coming in on the Kanc | 5 p.m. 

Beautiful during any time of the year, The Kancamagus Highway (also known as Route 112 and more affectionately - simply, the Kanc) really shines during the peak foliage months of late September and early October. The rolling hills and White Mountains provide a stunning backdrop to a drive no matter the color they are, be it white, green, yellow, red and everything in-between. Plentiful locations to pull off the road to take in the whole view exist as well. Worth the experience even if not on the way. Consider renting a bicycle, motorcycle or other form of alternative transportation for a fuller experience. 


### Putt Putt in to Town | 6 p.m. 

Who doesn’t like a game of mini-golf? North Conway offers a few options, but the friendliest staff and most intelligent and challenging layout goes to Banana Village Mini Golf. Welcoming all ages and abilities Banana Village is a fun place to stretch tired legs and walk around after a long drive — without being worn out. In the early evening a game of mini golf is a great way to spark some pre-dinner competition. 

### Surviving the Moat | 7 p.m.

Local brews and open late, Moat Mountain Smokehouse and Brewing offers up some of the best pub food around. The beer is made on location and offers up a wide variety of flavors, although none too ambitious. The pale ale is a local favorite, as is the blueberry beer in the summertime. Both are worth a try. The Moat also offers five-beer samplers for about the price of one pint, offering up a great way to try out many of their different offerings. The menu does not depart too far from a typical pub offering, but occasionally strays in favor of a Thai curry or Mediterranean seafood dish. But the best bet at the Moat is certainly their barbecue. The pulled pork sliders never stay on a plate for long. Babyback ribs come in one huge rack and the homemade glaze is worth the journey in itself. 

## Saturday

### Peaches for Breakfast | 10 a.m. 

The menu at Peaches is full of your typical bakery fare, including delicious breakfast sandwiches, omelets, pancakes, crepes, stuffed french toast, and a few varieties of Benedict’s. The Green Mountain sandwich may have a misleading name, but maybe that is because it is a standout sandwich. Homemade english muffins are stacked with fried eggs, cheddar cheese, fresh tomatoes and spinach. A solid selection of hot sauces are available to complete the deal. Add a generous portion of fresh fruit on the side and you are ready for whatever the rest of the day has in store. 

### Soaking in the Saco | 12 p.m.

Take a tour down the leisurely Saco River with Northern Extremes. Offering group or individual kayak tours in the summer and guided snowmobile tours in the winter, Northern Extremes has every season covered. A friendly staff helps transport you from place to place and guide you on your way Modern, quality equipment is available for a competitive price. Just make sure to stop before you reach the rapids! 

### White Mountain Winery | 4 p.m. 

Likely few travel to the White Mountains of New Hampshire for its local wines but if you happen to find yourself here a stop at the White Mountain Winery may be on tap. The recently opened business offers free samples Thursday through Saturday year round. They also offer up many different options to buy their products, from single bottles to the case and everything in between. The many varieties come from grapes all over the world and the winery creates their products in house. A great way to unwind after a day of exploring the natural beauty of North Conway. 

### Walkin’ it Off | 6 p.m. 

North Conway offers up many things to see or do. The one thing that cannot be ignored is the constant reminder of nature all around.

In the summer months there is almost always something going on, from three day long mud football tournaments to candlelight meditations to concerts. Its central location and free parking make it a great destination for the start of the evening’s festivities. And don’t forget the Ben & Jerry’s right next door for some pre-dinner desert. 

### An Irish Treat | 7 p.m. 

May Kelley’s Cottage Restaurant and Pub is a storied establishment in Central North Conway that caters to everyone. Families are welcome in the dinning room and the pub area caters to a rowdier crowd. In the summer months an outdoor patio offers great views of the surrounding mountains.

food and a great location make this a spot to see during any North Conway visit.

Beautiful scenery lines the way to and from the pools, winding along a river with waterfalls and running water to . 

### The Final Climb | 2 p.m.

A trip to the White Mountains would not be complete without a stop atop the highest peak in the Northeast, Mt. Washington. With an Elevation of 6,288 ft you won’t see a higher peak in sight. Just be sure to bring warm clothes whenever you go. Mt. Washington is home to some of the wildest weather on the planet. Some of the highest recorded wind gusts have happened there. Luckily for the casual visitor it is almost fully accessible by car. The Mt. Washington Auto Road winds up to the summit offering anyone the ability to reach the peak. For the more ambitious there are plentiful hiking options available. But this option is not for the faint of heart. A hike up the tallest peak in New Hampshire nearly always requires an overnight stay on the mountain.
